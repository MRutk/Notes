notes of git essentials from learnlinuxtv
 
 to initialize repository: git init [repository name]
 git init will create a directory with the repository name
 
 .git directory contains all info that makes it a repository
 
 git status - returns repository status, usable in repository directory
 	show files that changed since last commit
 
 git add - adding files to version controll/repo at least the local one 
 
 
 git config --global user.name "name" - ustablishing a system wide name of contributor
 
 git config --global user.email "email@mail" - ustablishing a system wide email of contributor
 
git diff [filename] - shows what changed in file since last commit

git commit -m "mesage goes here" - to commit
running without -m would bring up a text editor for commit message

git log --oneline - shows log of commits, displaying each commit as one line
 and shows each commits hashcode
 
git revert [hashcode] - reverts changes to previous commit, we're not inputing the hash of the commit we want to 'go' to, 
we are reverting a commit so the hash inputed needs to be 1 'above'.

git clone [https or shh here] - clones a remote repository to local storage, better not to call this from an existing repo

git remote add origin [https or ssh here] - adds an origin to the remote repo, usable when remote repo was created after local repo (remote repo becomes main)

git push origin master - push from origin to master/main (pushes to remote)
(on newer versions master is not used, main would be the correct terminology)

git pull - updates local repository with changes from main

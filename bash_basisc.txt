notes for bash scripting course from learnlinuxtv

---------basics-----------
echo $SHELL - if not shure which shell is currently operating this will printout
the current shell

which bash - if unsure this will show where bash interpreter is located 

theoreticaly a bash script is any text file with one or more commads written in it

saving script file with .sh extension is not required but will make life easier and is the standard practice

to execute script first it needs to be executable 
so either chmod +x [file], chmod -o +x [file], or go with absolutes like
chmod 764 [file]

every script should start with a 'binbash' <#!/bin.bash> to ensure the sript is using the intended interpreter

-----variables----
echo "string" - will print string
echo $variable_name - will print variable contents/value

in order to reference a variable we need to put a $ in front: <$variable_name>
(a 'neat' way of ensuring variables do not collide with command names)

using "" will ensure that specified variable names(preceded by $) in string will 
output variables value (echo "$variable_name" ----> variable_value)
using '' will interpret the string literaly (echo '$variable_name' ---> $variable_name)

declared variables dont persist through sessions

$(command)-subshell, can be assigned to a variable <variable_name=$(command)>
so a commands output can be easily save to a variable

a variable with name in allcaps is usually a system variable, custom variables should be named with lowercase names that is the standard practice so it is safe to asume variables with allcaps are system variables 

typing <env> will print out environment(system) variables in current session 

-------basic math-----

<expr> - evaluate expression allows for math operations within bash 
remember to add spaces b/w values and operands
multiplying needs an escape out ("\") before "*"
backslash "\" enables to escape out of a predefined/special character

operating with variables is ofcourse allowed but as before we need to use $variable_name to reference that variables value

------------if statements-------------------

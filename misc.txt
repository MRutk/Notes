various commands

currently recommended ssh key generation: <ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100>

for access to github they recommend to password protect and generate:
 <ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com">
 
 Keys will be generated with 600 permissions I believe 400 is the recommended permission level
